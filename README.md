# Country Details

Loyverse take home test.

Make a webapp for the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v2) to display country data.

### Brief

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder, you will find mobile and desktop designs for both pages. The designs are static images. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. Feel free to use any component libraries you may need. There are no assets for this challenge, as the country flags will be pulled from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v2) and you can use an icon font library for the icons. If you make any assumptions, trade-offs or de-prioritise features for timeliness, please document these decisions.

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Sort countries by population: most -> less
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
